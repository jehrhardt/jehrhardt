## Hi there 👋

I'm Jan, a cozy developer writing software that let's me sleep well at night 💤.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - 💫 [Cozy Coder](https://github.com/jehrhardt/cozycoder) - an open source collaborative space for coding with AI
  - 🔒 [Cozy Auth](https://github.com/jehrhardt/cozyauth) - an easy Passkey authentication
- 📺 You can join me building in public on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jehrhardt)
- 💬 Come into my [Cozy Dev Corner on Discord](https://discord.gg/QaCTXq2Gxm) to get in touch with me and other developers

Let's build something cozy, together! 🏠💕
